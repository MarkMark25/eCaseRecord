Installation
Require this package in the composer.json of your Laravel project. 
This will download the package and PhpSpreadsheet.

1. composer require maatwebsite/excel
The Maatwebsite\Excel\ExcelServiceProvider is auto-discovered and 
registered by default, but if you want to register it yourself:

Add the ServiceProvider in config/app.php

2. 'providers' => [
    /*
     * Package Service Providers...
     */
    Maatwebsite\Excel\ExcelServiceProvider::class,
]

The Excel facade is also auto-discovered, but if you want to add 
it manually:

Add the Facade in config/app.php

3. 'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Excel' => Maatwebsite\Excel\Facades\Excel::class,
]
To publish the config, run the vendor publish command:

4. php artisan vendor:publish
This will create a new config file named config/excel.php.
